# Script_Breakdown

# LEAP FROG BREAKDOWN Utility

This repository contains a Python-based utility designed to analyze and process movie scripts, extract specific details such as actions, dialogues, props, characters, and set designs, and generate a structured PDF output matching client expectations. The utility is built using machine learning models from Hugging Face and formatted with ReportLab for professional-grade PDF generation.

## Features

- **Script Analysis**: Segments scripts into scenes based on markers like `EXT.` and `INT.`.
- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**: Extracts key elements such as characters, props, and set design using Hugging Face models.
- **Custom Tagging**: Adds placeholders for categories like Hair/Makeup/Costume, Special Effects, and Extras.
- **PDF Generation**: Creates a structured, visually appealing PDF output with sections for all extracted categories.
- **Placeholder Support**: Marks missing categories with "N/A" as per client requirements.
