The first step that appears is “Downloading and learning a software”. She goes to the software and a pop up appears “Would you like to proceed through the tutorial. HANNAH (Confidently) Skip. She frustratedly tries to place a semi cylinder but an error appears repeatedly. “Cannot Render Item 00X1739174721345/2”. Hannah groans. Her head rests on her desk tapping a pencil, she sighs defeatedly. Her Dad peaks into her room without a noise, scoffs under his breath, then silently walks away. She stares at the frog on her window sill with interest and observes as it walks. The frog suddenly stops, angles itself to her, stares at her, and blinks. She continues tapping her pencil. Then glances again. The frog walks some more. Then hops off the window. 2. 3. She stares at where the frog once was, pondering. She looks back to her computer, takes a deep breath and goes to the learning website. She scrolls down a little bit from what she saw originally and it says “The thing about making a game is BABY STEPS”. Hannah giggles to herself. Cut to Hannah, a 15 year old during midnight designing a video game character. It resembles a human. Hannah has a computer instead of her old laptop. She looks at the computer and pulls on her hair and groans. Bored, she clicks through a plethora of character concepts. One alien, one robot, one astronaut etc. Her Father walks by again but, instead her Mother walks in. MOTHER Your Father said he keeps seeing you learning to make games. Hannah quickly clears her tabs. HANNAH Yah. MOTHER He’s right you know. You should give up on it, game developers don’t make anything close to what your father makes. He’s trying to raise you to be successful, not this. HANNAH (Sassy) Okkk. Her Mother leaves disappointed. Hannah wipes her face with her hand. Then rests her head on her desk. The frog on her window stares at her. She glances at the frog, then glances again. Her eyes widen and she lifts her head in realization. She grabs a sketch book and meticulously opens the window and slowly draws the frog from different angles. In drawing, she physically grabs the frog and turns it. As she carefully set down the frog, it turns its head sideways out of curiosity. The frog hops in her room and Hannah quickly reaches for it but falls off the stool she was sitting on. HANNAH (CONT’D) Wohhhhh. 3. 4. THUD. Hannah is animating the movements of the frog on her computer. END MONTAGE\n",

She ends up diving in the mud and the frog hops out of the way. HANNAH (CONT’D) Damn it, you, AGHHHHH. Hannah’s deep sorrow for her year’s worth of work has turned into anger. Hannah sprints, leaps, and dives at the frog, missing each time. Until eventually the frog is cornered under the porch. Hannah warily approaches the cornered frog and reaches both hands out. Angry tears flow down her face. The frog reverses away as the hands approach ever closer. The frog having no chance of escape manages to jump off the side of the wall, on to her face, out to the yard again, and into the open. Hannah with both knees on the ground sitting upright becomes dumbfounded. In light of the situation she becomes re- inspired. MONTAGE: (Music playing over all of this until the end).
